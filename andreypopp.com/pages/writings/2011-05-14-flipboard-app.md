Last few weeks, I'm reading Twitter, Facebook and Google Reader exclusively on
iPad, thanks to excellent [Flipboard][1] app. It makes reading social feeds a
real pleasure â€” images and videos are embedded into the great looking
magazine-style layout.

But how it works:

  * Does it use some ranking algorithm for presenting content?

  * What algorithm it uses for composing layout?

Interesting...
