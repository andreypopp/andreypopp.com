I think the fact that a lot of [Medium][1] posts show us a preliminary note
about its content being published on author's website or blog or somewhere else
previously already speaks a lot about Medium itself — they are not trying to
innovate one of the most important aspects of publishing — authorship culture.

People don't want to be published on faceless surrogates — they want to present
themselves originally, manifesting their uniqueness not only via content they
are producing but also through authentic look and feel.
