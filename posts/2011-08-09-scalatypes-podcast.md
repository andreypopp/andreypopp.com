I usually doesn't listen podcasts but have done an exception for
[ScalaTypes][1] — podcast about Scala and ecosystem around it.

Well... they talk not too much about Scala or even about topics
related to Scala. So I don't recommend this podcast for ones who wants
solid and concentrated insights on the topic :-).

Regarding last episode. It was an interview with [Heather Miller][3], she's
stated to be "New Documentation Czar" — she's now ruling an effort to provide
more solid and more deep covered documentation for Scala programming language.
And again I'm surprised — they didn't even mention [Sphinx][2], the current
state-of-art of documentation tools, which is sad... I really wish Scala
language and its standard library be documented with the use of Sphinx.
