Music streaming services are hot.

First, [YouTube to Launch Music Subscriptions][], which cannot be bad for
industry and for us, people. I still have a few questions regarding that.

Will YouTube allow for subscribers to listen to music without watching the
video? Will YouTube provide some kind of offline access for subscribers? If this
entire subscription thing is just about ad-free experience — I'm not sold at
all.

Second, [Streaming Music Service "Daisy" Raises $60 Million][] and then [Apple’s
Tim Cook Met With Beats To Talk About "Daisy"][], which is interesting at least.

It spawns rumors about possible acquistion [Beats][] (or just "Daisy") by Apple
or partnership between Apple and Beats. Both cases are very intriguing.

But the fact alone that Beats gets $60 million investments into its music
streaming service is very interesting. There's an [article on CNet] with quotes
from [Jimmy Iovine][] (the guy behind Beats) about his vision on music
experience through curated playlists.

I have to say, I kind of share his thoughts on music discovery — no single
algorithm can suggest you a next song better than a person whom taste you trust.

Discuss on [branch][]!
