When you read ["Brave New World"][1] by [Huxley][2] and imagine people raised in
bottles and programmed to be like machines — that scares you.

When you live and see yourself and all these people around you programmed
themselves without any bottles but to be the same… like machines — that scares
you a lot more.

Is that kind of the freedom you wanted to have?
