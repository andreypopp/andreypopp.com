There's no doubt Web works now but there's also now doubt it can work better. I
want to dream about how exactly it can do that. Let's talk about structured data
on the Web.

First and important — why do we need structured data on the Web in the first
place? I think, the main reason for that is a possibility to develop much more
sophisticated tools and UIs if structured data is available.

What's structured data? It's a database exposed in some uniform format.

Why there's no much structurd data available:

  * can't agree on protocol but schema.org and OpenGraph are doing quite good
  * no economy for that

Structured data is treated as a static thing. Web is moving to single page highly
dynamic apps, there's no place for markup based structured data directives —
there should be ActivityStreams.

Apps should expose ActivityStreams and not markup.
There should be an economy for that.

processes and aligned to how human operate.
