import {Post} from '../../Post';
export default Post;
export let title = "Better PEP-8"

Sorry, that is something I'd like to see in PEP-8:

  * Use 2 (not 4 as PEP-8 says) spaces per indentation level.

There's simple no reason to indent with 4 spaces; 2 spaces is optimal in a
sense of line width and also good for code readability.
