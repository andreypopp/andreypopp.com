There's excellent [overview][1] and comments on [Martijn Faassen][2]
djangocon.eu [keynote][4] about Zope and Django — what the former could learn
from the first one and so on.

Personally, I think Zope is excellent project which gave raise to the
current state of the art of pythonic web frameworks — [Pyramid][3].

Don't miss the links at the end of the article to projects which also (as
Pyramid and Zope do) implement object publishing via URL traversal --
[Fantastic][5] and [traject][6].
