How many users of app.net actually continue to pay for service without actual
usage? I'm wondering because this is what exactly happened to me recently — I've
been invited to service so I didn't pay for the first month of usage while I was
required to enter my credit card information. The month passed and I visited
app.net only once, still at the start of the next month my credit card was
charged.

If there are a lot of users like me then it just doesn't seem the right way to
build a business, doesn't it? I mean the business which builds upon users who just
forget about recurring payments towards a service they don't use — this kind of
business just doesn't feel right.

Another interesting aspect of app.net business model is that it somehow inspires
application (for app.net) creators to use the same (or similar) model. As an
example, there is [Twapp][1] application which translates twitter messages into
app.net messages for you — this application require you to pay $5 as a "setup
fee".

As you can see I'm quite skeptical about app.net but at the same time I think
this is quite an interesting case. Looking forward to it, anyway.

## Update

According to [tweet][2] from [@sevanjaniyan][3], new invitees do not need to
enter credit card information anymore. But I think everything above is still
applicable if there are a lot of accounts created by curiosity and then
abandoned.
